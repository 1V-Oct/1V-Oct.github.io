      "title": "A New Core for Your Rack",
      "body": "The Centre redefines what's possible within a single Eurorack module. At its core, it's a high-fidelity wavetable synthesizer, but its true power lies in its <strong>\"modular-in-modular\"</strong> architecture.<br>This concept allows you to build complex patches by connecting virtual modules—oscillators, filters, envelopes, and LFOs—all within The Centre itself. This approach mirrors the workflow of a DAW while retaining the hands-on immediacy of hardware, supporting up to <strong>4-voice polyphony</strong> to transform an entire patch into a multi-voiced instrument.",
      "short": "The Centre is a powerful polyphonic synthesizer module for Eurorack, featuring modular-in-modular architecture, 4 V/OCT inputs, and 4 DC-coupled outputs. It offers high-quality sound with 32-bit floating point processing, a variety of built-in modules, and extensive connectivity options.",
      "long": "The Centre is a groundbreaking polyphonic synthesizer module designed for Eurorack systems. It features a modular-in-modular architecture that allows users to create complex patches with ease. With 4 V/OCT calibrated inputs and 4 DC-coupled outputs, The Centre provides extensive connectivity options for integrating with other modules and external gear. The module boasts high-quality sound processing with 32-bit floating point architecture, ensuring pristine audio quality. It includes a variety of built-in modules such as a wavetable oscillator, arpeggiator, envelope generator, and more, making it a versatile tool for sound design and music production."
