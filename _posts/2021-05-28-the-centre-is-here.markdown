The Centre is a 16hp Eurorack module that is a wavetable-based complex oscillator and a percussive-oriented sound source. It's designed to be the heart of your modular system, providing a wide range of sonic possibilities from lush pads to aggressive leads and complex percussive textures. We've poured countless hours into its development, and we can't wait for you to hear it.
